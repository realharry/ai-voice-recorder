# Microphone Permission Fix - Technical Notes

## Problem
The extension was failing with "Microphone permission denied in popup context: [object DOMException]" because the initial implementation incorrectly tried to request microphone permissions in the popup context first, then use them in the offscreen document.

## Root Cause
Chrome Extension Manifest V3 security model:
- Microphone permissions requested in popup context don't transfer to offscreen documents
- Offscreen documents need their own getUserMedia() calls with proper user activation context
- User activation context must be properly propagated through the message chain

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Popup Permission Request
- Deleted `requestMicrophonePermission()` function from `chromeMessages.ts`
- Removed the two-phase permission flow that was causing the issue

### 2. User Activation Context Propagation
- Modified popup to send `userActivation: true` with START_RECORDING message
- Updated background script to accept and forward userActivation parameter
- Enhanced offscreen document to receive userActivation parameter

### 3. Direct Offscreen Permission Handling
- Offscreen document now calls getUserMedia() directly
- Proper error handling for different DOMException types
- Enhanced user feedback with specific error messages

## Message Flow
```
Popup (user click) → Background Script → Offscreen Document
  userActivation: true     ↓              ↓
                    START_RECORDING → START_OFFSCREEN_RECORDING
                    + userActivation   + userActivation
                                            ↓
                                      getUserMedia()
                                      (with user activation context)
```

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/chromeMessages.ts` - Removed popup permission request
- `src/components/AudioRecorder.tsx` - Simplified to direct recording start
- `src/background.ts` - Added userActivation parameter handling
- `src/offscreen.ts` - Enhanced to accept userActivation and handle permissions directly

This approach follows Chrome Extension Manifest V3 best practices for microphone access in offscreen documents.
